# ELEC291
Design projects involving electronic devices and circuits, electromagnetism, signals and systems, and microcomputers.

## Lab 1
Introduction to microcontroller systems. The 8051 microcontroller architecture. The AT89LP51RC2 microcontroller. Initialization and usage of character based LCDs.Compilation and loading of assembly programs.

## Lab 2 
Using timers, interrupts, and pushbuttons with microcontrollers. Time keeping and user interfacing with microcontrollers. Sound generation using interrupts.

## Lab 3 
The 555 timer.  Use timers and counters to measure frequency, period, and pulse width with microcontrollers. Use the 555 timer to measure capacitance and resistance. Learn to read the capacitance value printed in off the shelf capacitors. Using infrared transistors and light emitting diodes to detect heart rate.  Multistage amplification and filtering using operational amplifiers.

## Project 1
Design,  build,  program,  and  test  a  microcontroller  based  capacitive sensors reaction game.  This game will produce an audible signal using a speaker, wait for two or more  players  input  from  capacitive  sensors,  decide  who  wins  the  round,  and  keep  a  record  of points for each player using the LCD.

## Lab 4
Design temperature sensor using a digital thermometer that will serially transmit the temperature to a personal computer using the serial port.Then program the personal computer using Python to receive the temperature and conveniently present it in real time using a strip chart plot.

## Lab 5
Design, build, program, and test a microprocessor based AC voltmeter that displays both magnitude and phase with MCP3008 chip.
